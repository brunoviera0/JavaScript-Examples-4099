2.

3. A unique aspect of JavaScript are first class functions. Functions take the highest priority in JavaScript, meaning that they can be passed as arguments in another function, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. Please demonstrate how first class functions operate by writing a brief JavaScript program that creates a function that takes as an argument a name and another function that determines what the greeting will be. Lastly, write seperate functions that determine diferent greetings.
