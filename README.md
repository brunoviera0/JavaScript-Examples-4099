# JavaScript-Examples-4099

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate and familiarize yourself with the power of JavaScript.

1. A unique aspect of JavaScript are first class functions. Functions take the highest priority in JavaScript, meaning that they can be passed as arguments in another function, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. Please demonstrate how first class functions operate by writing a brief JavaScript program that creates a function that takes as an argument a name and another function that determines what the greeting will be. Lastly, write seperate functions that determine diferent greetings.

2. A closure in JavaScript occurs when a function remembers the variables from it's lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. In this exercise, you'll create a function that returns another function to be a counter. Each time you call the returned function, it will increase a number and display it. Even though the first function has finished running, the inner function still remembers and updates the number. This demonstrates a closure because the inner function keeps access to the data from the outer function, allowing it to continue updating the number on each call.
